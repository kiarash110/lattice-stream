💠 Lattice Unified | v1.0.0High-Performance Data Compression & Archival SuiteLattice Unified is a professional-grade utility engineered for massive-scale data management. It specializes in bridging the gap between high-capacity storage (1TB+) and rapid deployment through a specialized dual-engine compression architecture.## 📥 Core CapabilitiesBimodal Compression Logic: Seamlessly toggle between Nitro Mode (utilizing the Zstandard algorithm for maximum throughput) and Squeeze Mode (utilizing LZMA for deep archival ratios).Buffered Data Streaming: Optimized for low-memory environments, the engine processes datasets in controlled chunks to ensure system stability even when handling terabyte-scale files.Intelligent Namespace Protection: Integrated logic automatically detects file naming conflicts and applies non-destructive versioning to prevent accidental data loss.Structural Fidelity: Unlike standard tools, Lattice preserves the exact directory hierarchy of compressed folders, ensuring seamless restoration.Active Telemetry Dashboard: A specialized UI layer provides live feedback on hardware strain, memory overhead, and effective space savings.## 💻 Technical ArchitectureLayerImplementationLogic CorePython 3.12+ (Optimized for 64-bit systems)Nitro EngineFacebook's Zstandard (Zstd)Archival EngineLZMA / Tar-StreamInterfaceCustomTkinter (Modern GUI Framework)MonitoringPSUtil Hardware Integration## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Setup### 1. Environment PreparationBefore deployment, ensure your system is equipped with the following:Python 3.12+: Required for modern memory management and core stability.Git SCM: Essential for secure version control and repository management.### 2. Local DeploymentExecute the following sequence in your terminal to initialize the suite:Bash# Obtain source code
git clone https://github.com/kiarash110/Lattice-Unified.git

# Enter project root
cd Lattice-Unified

# Provision environment dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
## 🛠️ Operational MaintenanceInterface Unresponsiveness: Large-scale operations (100GB+) may cause the UI to appear static while the processor is under heavy load. Refer to the real-time telemetry stats; if the RAM or Elapsed Time is ticking, the engine is healthy.Disk Permissions: The compression engine requires direct write access. If "Access Denied" errors occur, verify that your terminal or IDE has administrative privileges over the target drive.Hardware Bottlenecks: Throughput speed is dictated by your physical drive (HDD vs. NVMe). If the progress indicator stalls, the engine is likely waiting for disk I/O. Do not interrupt the process to avoid archive corruption.## 📋 Project Configuration FilesDependency Manifest (requirements.txt)Ensure these specific libraries are provisioned in your environment:zstandardpsutilcustomtkintertkinterdnd2Exclusion Logic (.gitignore)To maintain a clean repository, ensure the following are excluded from your commits:Compiled Python files (__pycache__)Active archive files (.zst, .gem, .tar)System metadata (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)## ⚖️ Legal & ComplianceTrademark Information: Lattice Unified is an independent open-source project.
